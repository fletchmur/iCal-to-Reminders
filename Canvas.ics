DESCRIPTION:------------------------------------------------------\nWeek1 T
 hursday Reading Response: Why do names matter?\n--------------------------
 ----------------------------\n\n[person typing at a laptop] (https://byu.i
 nstructure.com/courses/22955/files/7169393/download)\n\nEvery time you see
  a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch
  a video\, you will gather information that will be useful to you in your 
 class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especially your
  final exam.  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs and at
  least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n-------
 --------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summar
 ies\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 
 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or vide
 o(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph if that works. 
 If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into paragraphs and use 
 a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will
  help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that will 
 help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Since the final is 
 open note\, this section will help you to find what you need quickly if yo
 u organize it by question. So I would divide this portion into 5 parts\, o
 ne for each question. Some days you won't have anything for most of the se
 ctions\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the
  questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion questio
 ns. What do you think the class should discuss about these readings and vi
 ewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended questions\, compa
 risons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and more. You can see
  an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called [Sample Readin
 g Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-readin
 g-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses are
  due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you as 
 much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives me time to read
  your questions and add them to the discussion on some days.) Plan your ti
 me so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the
  final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, so
 lutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your place to
  gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirational people.
   This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too superficial and
  short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you later in the se
 mester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cumulative final
 . The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This A
 ssignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this second assignment\
 , you have several short readings. To stay sane you will need to keep your
  summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just one sentence for each readi
 ng that captures the point of it and differentiates it from the others.

 ------------\n\nIn this discussion\, you will have an initial post and two
  responses to your classmates. Your initial post will be due before Saturd
 ay night. Your responses to classmates are due by Monday night. \n\nFor t
 his week\, please do the following:\n-------------------------------------
 --\n\nListen to Dar William's You're Aging Well and focus on the themes in
  the lyrics below:\n\nWhy is it that as we grow older and stronger\nThe ro
 ad signs point us adrift and make us afraid\nSaying "You never can win\, "
  "Watch your back\, " "Where's your husband?"\nOh\, I don't like the signs
  that the sign makers made.\n\nSo I'm going to steal out with my paint and
  brushes\nI'll change the directions\, I'll hit every street\nIt's the Tin
 seltown scandal\, the Robin Hood vandal\nShe goes out and steals the king'
 s English\nAnd in the morning you wake up and the signs point to you\n\nTh
 ey say\n"I'm so glad that you finally made it here\,"\n"You thought nobody
  cared\, but I did\, I could tell\,"\nAnd "This is your year\, " and "It a
 lways starts here\,"\nAnd oh "You're aging well."\n\nWell I know a woman w
 ith a collection of sticks\nShe could fight back the hundreds of voices sh
 e heard\nAnd she could poke at the greed\, she could fend off her need\nAn
 d with anger she found she could pound every word.\nBut one voice got thro
 ugh\, caught her up by surprise\nIt said\, "Don't hold us back\, we're the
  story you tell\,"\nAnd no sooner than spoken\, a spell had been broken\nA
 nd the voices before her were trumpets and tympani\nViolins\, basses and w
 oodwinds and cellos\, singing\n\n"We're so glad that you finally made it h
 ere\nYou thought nobody cared\, but we did\, we could tell\nAnd now you'll
  dance through the days while the orchestra plays\nAnd oh\, you're aging w
 ell."\n\nNow when I was fifteen\, oh\, I knew it was over\nThe road to enc
 hantment was not mine to take\n'Cause lower calf\, upper arm should be hal
 f what they are\nI was breaking the laws that the sign makers made.\n\nAnd
  all I could eat was the poisonous apple\nAnd that's not a story I was mea
 nt to survive\nI was all out of choices\, but the woman of voices\n\nShe t
 urned round the corner with music around her\,\nShe gave me the language t
 hat keeps me alive\, she said:\n\n"I'm so glad that you finally made it he
 re\nWith the things you know now\, that only time could tell\nLooking back
 \, seeing far\, landing right where we are\nAnd oh\, you're aging\, oh and
  I am aging\,\nOh\, aren't we aging well?"\n\nSource: [LyricFind] (https:
 //www.lyricfind.com/)\n\nSongwriters: Dar Williams\n\nYou're Aging Well ly
 rics © BMG Rights Management\n\nPrompt\n------\n\nParagraph one:  What a
 re the signs that the singer is talking about\, and what messages do they 
 give to women about themselves? In what way are the signs damaging or dang
 erous to a woman's self-concept? \n\nParagraph two: In the first verse th
 e singer changes the signs she doesn't like with the "Tinseltown scandal/t
 he Robin Hood Vandal." What are some ways you can think of to resist signs

DESCRIPTION:---------------------------------------------------------------
 \nWeek2 Tuesday Reading Response: Identities & Intersectionality\n--------
 -------------------------------------------------------\n\n[woman of color
  wearing flowers on her head] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/f
 iles/7169395/download)\n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article or c
 hapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gather inf
 ormation that will be useful to you in your class discussions\, your proje
 cts\, your final paper\, and especially your final exam.  Each homework r
 esponse should contain two paragraphs and at least three suggested discuss
 ion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three pa
 rts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the fi
 nal\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise 
 summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the 
 summaries into one paragraph if that works. If it feels too confusing\, yo
 u can break them up into paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nPa
 ragraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will help you on the final. Gather
  names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that will help you to construct your ans
 wers for the final exam. Since the final is open note\, this section will 
 help you to find what you need quickly if you organize it by question. So 
 I would divide this portion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some day
 s you won't have anything for most of the sections\, other days you'll nee
 d to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions:
  \n-------------\n\nThree discussion questions. What do you think the cla
 ss should discuss about these readings and viewings? Some possible questio
 n types would be open-ended questions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil
 's advocate questions\, and more. You can see an example of this assignmen
 t in the Welcome module called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.inst
 ructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease
  Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses are due two hours before class o
 n Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you as much time as possible to proc
 rastinate\, and then it gives me time to read your questions and add them 
 to the discussion on some days.) Plan your time so that you can turn these
  in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the final exam as your guide: ga
 ther problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These readin
 g responses are your lifeline\, your place to gather knowledge and to writ
 e down great ideas and inspirational people.  This is a deceptively simpl
 e assignment\, and being too superficial and short in your reading journal
  will come back to haunt you later in the semester. You can use your notes
  on your quizzes and on the cumulative final. The notes are your future\, 
 so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This Assignment\n-------------------
 -------------\n\nFor this assignment\, you have 3 short readings\, a confe
 rence talk\, a handout\, and three short videos. Again\, there are lots of
  short ones. Try to write just one sentence for each reading that captures
  the point of it and only write down something for the videos if you don't
  understand them\,

 nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. R

 -----\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) assign

 -------------------------------\n\nFor this first assignment\, write a sum
 mary of Travis Anderson's article and Emily Dickinson's poem "Disenchantme
 nt" for section 1. Write any general notes you think might be useful under
  a section 2 for the final questions. And then write three discussion ques
 tions from these readings just to practice and so you can get some TA feed
 back.

DESCRIPTION:--------------------------------------------------------\nWeek2
  Thursday Reading Response: Construction of Gender\n----------------------
 ----------------------------------\n\n[typewriter with a page that says ge
 nder roles] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7169394/downl
 oad)\n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, l
 isten to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gather information that will
  be useful to you in your class discussions\, your projects\, your final p
 aper\, and especially your final exam.  Each homework response should con
 tain two paragraphs and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n
 \nThe Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three parts to these readi
 ng responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussi
 on questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the rea
 ding(s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one
  paragraph if that works. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them u
 p into paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------
 ------\n\nThings that will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, q
 uotes and ideas that will help you to construct your answers for the final
  exam. Since the final is open note\, this section will help you to find w
 hat you need quickly if you organize it by question. So I would divide thi
 s portion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have a
 nything for most of the sections\, other days you'll need to put things do
 wn for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n
 \nThree discussion questions. What do you think the class should discuss a
 bout these readings and viewings? Some possible question types would be op
 en-ended questions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questio
 ns\, and more. You can see an example of this assignment in the Welcome mo
 dule called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses
 /22955/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n-----------
 -\n\nReading Responses are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thur
 sdays. (This gives you as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and the
 n it gives me time to read your questions and add them to the discussion o
 n some days.) Plan your time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n
 \nUse the questions on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dyn
 amics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are you
 r lifeline\, your place to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas 
 and inspirational people.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and 
 being too superficial and short in your reading journal will come back to 
 haunt you later in the semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes an
 d on the cumulative final. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n
 \nInstructions for This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFo
 r this second assignment\, you have several short readings. To stay sane y
 ou will need to keep your summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just on
 e sentence for each reading that captures the point of it and differentiat
 es it from the others.

 ----------------\n\n[crop of woman in wheelchair playing a sport] (https:/

 ou see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or

  your class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especiall

 and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n-
 --------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. 
 Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nPara
 graph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) o
 r video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph if that w
 orks. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into paragraphs an
 d use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings tha
 t will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that
  will help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Since the fin
 al is open note\, this section will help you to find what you need quickly
  if you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion into 5 par
 ts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have anything for most of 
 the sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 
 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion q
 uestions. What do you think the class should discuss about these readings 
 and viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended questions\,
  comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and more. You c
 an see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called [Sample 
 Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-
 reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReading Respons
 es are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives y
 ou as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives me time t
 o read your questions and add them to the discussion on some days.) Plan y
 our time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions 
 on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, idea
 s\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your pl
 ace to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirational pe

  see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or w
 atch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful to you in y
 our class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especially 
 your final exam.  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs an
 d at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---
 ------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Su
 mmaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagr
 aph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or

 s Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this second assignme

 hursday Reading Response: Body Image & Lookism\n--------------------------
 ----------------------------\n\n[woman looking at her reflection in glass]
  (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7169401/download)\n\nEve
 ry time you see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a 
 song\, or watch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful 
 to you in your class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and 
 especially your final exam.  Each homework response should contain two pa
 ragraphs and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three
  Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading response
 s:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion question
 s\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or 
 song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph 
 if that works. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into para
 graphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nT
 hings that will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and i
 deas that will help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Sinc
 e the final is open note\, this section will help you to find what you nee
 d quickly if you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion i
 nto 5 parts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have anything for
  most of the sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 
 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree dis
 cussion questions. What do you think the class should discuss about these 
 readings and viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended qu
 estions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and mo
 re. You can see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called
  [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/page
 s/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReadin
 g Responses are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (Thi
 s gives you as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives 
 me time to read your questions and add them to the discussion on some days
 .) Plan your time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the q
 uestions on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, nam
 es\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\
 , your place to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspira
 tional people.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too s
 uperficial and short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you l
 ater in the semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cu
 mulative final. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructi
 ons for This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this seco
 nd assignment\, you have several short readings. To stay sane you will nee
 d to keep your summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just one sentence 
 for each reading that captures the point of it and differentiates it from 
 the others.

DESCRIPTION:-----------------------------------------\nWeek4 Saturday Gende
 red Praxis Proposal\n-----------------------------------------\n\n[woman i
 n city street at night] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7
 222850/download)\n\nGendered Praxis\n\nProposal Instructions\n------------
 ---------\n\nPropose the way in which you are going to interact with the w
 orld in the next month to notice gender and the part it plays in your dail
 y interactions. \n\nYou should use one of my ideas\, revise it to fit you
 r life\, or come up with one of your own ideas. \n\nIn order to receive f
 ull credit\, you should find an interaction that you have regularly—you'
 ll want to have about 20 interactions during the course of the project\, t
 o experience and to report on\, both in your observation log\, and in your
  video report to the class. The point is to create sustainable\, habit-for
 ming ways in which you either make the gendered world visible to yourself 
 and others\, or subvert it somehow. \n\nWe are working on GWS 222 learnin
 g outcomes 3 and 5 and perhaps also 6 & 7: \n\n3. Students will recognize
  how structures\, systems\, and historical events affect women’s lives a
 nd contribute to social inequalities.\n\n5. Students will make informed ch
 oices about their own behavior\, health\, education\, and employment decis
 ions based on their understanding of the role gender plays in relationship
 s and society.\n\n6. Students will use their GWS education to improve the 
 lives of women and families and effect positive change in their communitie
 s.\n\n7. Students will increase in empathy for others\, particularly those
  who are unlike them.\n\n Your proposal below can be just a paragraph or 
 so explaining how you intend to put the theories we have learned into prac
 tice into your life. Write down any concerns or backup plans you might nee
 d if things don't go the way you plan. \n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\nPl
 ease do not choose anything that will\n\na. cost you money\n\nb. get you i
 n trouble with the law\,  or\n\nc. jeopardize your standing at the univer
 sity or with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\n\nd. need an
  IRB review (you won't be surveying your roommates or family members or fr
 iends\, because that would mean that you're using human subjects\, and tha
 t requires an Institutional Review Board to sign off on it to ensure that 
 you're not mistreating people for your research)\n\nIdeas\n-----\n\nA few 
 ideas to get you thinking:\n\nA. Speak gynocentric English: make all examp
 les and samples female in nouns and pronouns\; put females first when refe
 rring to “women & men” “girls & boys” "I don't know her from Eve" 
 "They're a Jenny-come-lately" and any other ways you can think of to subve
 rt androcentric language. What kinds of interactions and conversations doe
 s your speech start? Who notices what you're doing and who seems to ignore
  it?\n\nB. Play patriarchy chicken: [https://www.newstatesman.com/politi
 cs/feminism/2019/02/how-play-patriarchy-chicken-why-i-refuse-move-out-way-
 menLinks to an external site.] (https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/femi
 nism/2019/02/how-play-patriarchy-chicken-why-i-refuse-move-out-way-men)Wha
 t sorts of reactions do you get from men as you do this? Does age/power/po
 sition seem to matter?\n\nC. Read the news filtered through the Jailbreak
  the Patriarchy Chrome Extension. Compare 2 different news sources or diff
 erent sections of a news site and analyze which one is the most affected b
 y gender. How does your view of the news change because you're reading thi
 s way? Do you notice a difference between your view of the news now and th
 e way that your friends/roommates/family sees it?\n\nD. Track the amount 
 of speaking women do in your classes\, meetings\, and in other conversatio
 ns. Track these and then analyze them according to the numbers of women & 
 men in the class (is the ratio of men to women\, also the ratio of time sp
 ent listening to men vs. women? Is there a difference in courses where the
  professor is a woman vs. a man? Is there a difference in the ratios of ch
 urch meetings vs. classes?). These are just ideas—you should personalize
  this to your classes/meetings/major to see what differences there might b
 e. \n\nE. Work against the natural tendency toward homophily: for 20+ int
 eractions\, choose the cafeteria line\, the checkout line\, the salesperso
 n\, the greeter/usher/etc. who appears to be least like you in the big 8 s
 ocial identities. If you're with others\, notice which people they are nat
 urally drawn to. Try to engage your cashier/usher/etc. in small talk where
  appropriate. Notice your reactions and impressions. \n\nF. If you are ma
 rried\, sit down with your spouse and have a discussion about housework a
 nd division of labor. Try it for a week and see if you can have an equitab
 le division by hours spent\, or by square footage\, or some other metric. 
 Or discuss the mental load and explore how you might share that load more 
 equitably (you will need to figure out a way to ensure that this meets the
  20 interactions for a final project-sized sample). \n\nG. Keep looking f
 or possibilities in your life where gender is visible. If you're a server\
 , pick a friend of the opposite gender and compare your tips each shift to
  see who is getting more. Discuss why you think it happens. Or if you're a
  graphic designer\, choose to use only images of women and minorities in y
 our work and see if anyone notices or if there is a different reaction to 
 your work. What other places can you think of where you can play with and 
 subvert gendered interactions or inequities—where you can loosen up huma
 n interactions?\n\nH. You could also think about these ideas\, though you'
 ll have to propose a way to ensure that you'll have at least 20 interactio
 ns so that you have a final project-sized sample: \n\nHolding open the do
 or for men/women and tracking their reactions\n\nAsking for pronouns when 
 introduced to someone\n\nAmplifying female or minority voices in classes a
 nd meetings\n\nI look forward to hearing your proposals!\n\nSample\n------
 \n\nI once learned that women and POC often move out of the way first when
  approaching a man\n(white men specifically) straight-on while walking. Fo
 r my feminist praxis\, I would like to keep\ntrack of this. I will hold my
  ground and observe who moves out of my way most willingly\, and\nwho I bu

 ll as if they are\nlikely POC or white. I walk to school\, so I often pass
  a number of people every day.[] (https://unsplash.com/photos/hMLLPsxyTGs)

 you are going to interact with the world in the next month to notice gende
 r and the part it plays in your daily interactions.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>You sho
 uld use one of my ideas\, revise it to fit your life\, or come up with one
  of your own ideas.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>In order to receive full credit\, you s
 hould find an interaction that you have regularly—you'll want to have ab
 out 20 interactions during the course of the project\, to experience and t
 o report on\, both in your observation log\, and in your video report to t
 he class. The point is to create sustainable\, habit-forming ways in which
  you either make the gendered world visible to yourself and others\, or su
 bvert it somehow.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>We are working on GWS 222 learning outcom
 es 3 and 5 and perhaps also 6 &amp\; 7:&nbsp\;</p>\n<p><span>3. Students w
 ill recognize how structures\, systems\, and historical events affect wome
 n’s lives and contribute to social inequalities.</span></p>\n<p><span>5.
  Students will make informed choices about their own behavior\, health\, e
 ducation\, and employment decisions based on their understanding of the ro
 le gender plays in relationships and society.</span></p>\n<p><span>6. Stud
 ents will use their GWS education to improve the lives of women and famili
 es and effect positive change in their communities.</span></p>\n<p><span>7
 . Students will increase in empathy for others\, particularly those who ar
 e unlike them.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp\;<span>Your proposal below can be just
  a paragraph or so explaining how you intend to put the theories we have l
 earned into practice into your life. Write down any concerns or backup pla
 ns you might need if things don't go the way you plan.&nbsp\;</span></p>\n
 </div>\n<div id="kl_custom_block_1" class="">\n<h3 style="background-color

 <p><span>b. get you in trouble with the law\,&nbsp\; or</span></p>\n<p><sp
 an>c. jeopardize your standing at the university or with the Church of Jes
 us Christ of Latter Day Saints</span></p>\n<p><span>d. need an IRB review 
 (you won't be surveying your roommates or family members or friends\, beca
 use that would mean that you're using human subjects\, and that requires a

 're not mistreating people for your research)</span></p>\n</div>\n<div id=

 ong></p>\n<p><span>A. Speak gynocentric English: make all examples and sam
 ples female in nouns and pronouns\; put females first when referring to 
 “women &amp\; men” “girls &amp\; boys” "I don't know her from Eve"
  "They're a Jenny-come-lately" and any other ways you can think of to subv
 ert androcentric language. What kinds of interactions and conversations do
 es your speech start? Who notices what you're doing and who seems to ignor
 e it?</span></p>\n<p><span>B. Play</span><span>&nbsp\;patriarchy chicken:&
 nbsp\;</span><a class="external" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politi

 men" target="_blank"><span>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/
 2019/02/how-play-patriarchy-chicken-why-i-refuse-move-out-way-men</span><s
 pan class="external_link_icon" role="presentation"><span class="screenread
 er-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><span>What sorts of r
 eactions do you get from men as you do this? Does age/power/position seem 
 to matter?</span></p>\n<p><span>C.&nbsp\;</span><span>Read the news filter
 ed through the Jailbreak the Patriarchy Chrome Extension. Compare 2 differ
 ent news sources or different sections of a news site and analyze which on
 e is the most affected by gender. How does your view of the news change be
 cause you're reading this way? Do you notice a difference between your vie
 w of the news now and the way that your friends/roommates/family sees it?<
 /span></p>\n<p><span>D.&nbsp\;</span><span>Track the amount of speaking wo
 men do in your classes\, meetings\, and in other conversations. Track thes
 e and then analyze them according to the numbers of women &amp\; men in th
 e class (is the ratio of men to women\, also the ratio of time spent liste
 ning to men vs. women? Is there a difference in courses where the professo
 r is a woman vs. a man? Is there a difference in the ratios of church meet
 ings vs. classes?). These are just ideas—you should personalize this to 
 your classes/meetings/major to see what differences there might be.&nbsp\;
 </span></p>\n<p><span>E. Work against the natural tendency toward homophil
 y: for 20+ interactions\, choose the cafeteria line\, the checkout line\, 
 the salesperson\, the greeter/usher/etc. who appears to be least like you 
 in the big 8 social identities. If you're with others\, notice which peopl
 e they are naturally drawn to. Try to engage your cashier/usher/etc. in sm
 all talk where appropriate. Notice your reactions and impressions.&nbsp\;<
 /span></p>\n<p><span>F. </span><span>If you are married\,&nbsp\;</span><sp
 an>sit down with your spouse and have a discussion about housework and div
 ision of labor. Try it for a week and see if you can have an equitable div
 ision by hours spent\, or by square footage\, or some other metric. Or dis
 cuss the mental load and explore how you might share that load more equita
 bly (you will need to figure out a way to ensure that this meets the 20 in
 teractions for a final project-sized sample).&nbsp\;</span></p>\n<p><span>
 G. Keep looking for possibilities in your life where gender is visible. If
  you're a server\, pick a friend of the opposite gender and compare your t
 ips each shift to see who is getting more. Discuss why you think it happen
 s. Or if you're a graphic designer\, choose to use only images of women an
 d minorities in your work and see if anyone notices or if there is a diffe
 rent reaction to your work. What other places can you think of where you c
 an play with and subvert gendered interactions or inequities—where you c
 an loosen up human interactions?</span></p>\n<p><span>H. You could also th
 ink about these ideas\, though you'll have to propose a way to ensure that
  you'll have at least 20 interactions so that you have a final project-siz
 ed sample:&nbsp\;</span></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 40px\;"><span>Holdin

 day: Reading Response: LGBTQIA+ Part I\n----------------------------------
 ----------------\n\n[fingers with writing that says LGBTQIA+] (https://byu
 .instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7169402/download)\n\nEvery time you s
 ee a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or wat
 ch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful to you in you
 r class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especially yo
 ur final exam.  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs and 
 at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n-----
 ----------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summ
 aries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagrap
 h 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or vi
 deo(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph if that works
 . If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into paragraphs and us
 e a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that wi
 ll help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that wil
 l help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Since the final i
 s open note\, this section will help you to find what you need quickly if 
 you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion into 5 parts\,
  one for each question. Some days you won't have anything for most of the 
 sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of t
 he questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion quest
 ions. What do you think the class should discuss about these readings and 
 viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended questions\, com
 parisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and more. You can s
 ee an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called [Sample Read
 ing Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-read
 ing-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses a
 re due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you a
 s much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives me time to re
 ad your questions and add them to the discussion on some days.) Plan your 
 time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on t
 he final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, 
 solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your place 
 to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirational people
 .  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too superficial an
 d short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you later in the s
 emester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cumulative fina
 l. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This 
 Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nYou will be tested on the 
 glossary on Canvas\, but not on the page from GVFV (I want students to und
 erstand the many\, many\, many terms that an individual might use to descr
 ibe how they see themselves). So in this response\, just focus on summariz
 ing those first three articles.

 Instructions for This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor 
 this assignment\, you have three readings of varying length\, and a 10-min
 ute TED talk. You should have more to say about the Invention of Heterosex
 uality to summarize the author's argument than you will about the blog pos
 t. And do consider in section 2 what these readings tell us about intersec
 tionality and how it might apply to the last question about the workplace.

 ----------------------------\n\n[small girl's face] (https://byu.instructu
 re.com/courses/22955/files/7169405/download)\n\nEvery time you see a film\
 , read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video
 \, you will gather information that will be useful to you in your class di
 scussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especially your final e
 xam.  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs and at least t
 hree suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---------------
 \n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2
 . Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n----
 --------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) ass
 igned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph if that works. If it fe
 els too confusing\, you can break them up into paragraphs and use a "summa
 ries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will help yo
 u on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that will help you
  to construct your answers for the final exam. Since the final is open not
 e\, this section will help you to find what you need quickly if you organi
 ze it by question. So I would divide this portion into 5 parts\, one for e
 ach question. Some days you won't have anything for most of the sections\,
  other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questio
 ns. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion questions. What
  do you think the class should discuss about these readings and viewings? 
 Some possible question types would be open-ended questions\, comparisons\,
  applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and more. You can see an exam
 ple of this assignment in the Welcome module called [Sample Reading Respon
 se] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-reading-journa

  hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you as much tim
 e as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives me time to read your qu
 estions and add them to the discussion on some days.) Plan your time so th
 at you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the final e
 xam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\
 , etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your place to gather 
 knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirational people.  This i
 s a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too superficial and short in
  your reading journal will come back to haunt you later in the semester. Y
 ou can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cumulative final. The not

 see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or wa
 tch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful to you in yo
 ur class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especially y
 our final exam.  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs and
  at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n----
 -----------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Sum
 maries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagra
 ph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or v
 ideo(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph if that work
 s. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into paragraphs and u
 se a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that w
 ill help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that wi
 ll help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Since the final 
 is open note\, this section will help you to find what you need quickly if
  you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion into 5 parts\
 , one for each question. Some days you won't have anything for most of the
  sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of 
 the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion ques
 tions. What do you think the class should discuss about these readings and
  viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended questions\, co
 mparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and more. You can 
 see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called [Sample Rea
 ding Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-rea
 ding-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses 
 are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you 
 as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives me time to r
 ead your questions and add them to the discussion on some days.) Plan your
  time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on 
 the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\,
  solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your place

 e.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too superficial a
 nd short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you later in the

 al. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This
  Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nYou'll want to talk about
  Harriet here\, but don't forget to discuss the readings. I feel like the 
 Kendi and the Melton chapters have a very useful conversation for us\, so 
 be sure to include them.

 \nWeek7 Tuesday Reading Response: First Wave Feminism & Suffrage\n--------
 -------------------------------------------------------\n\n[three women in
  hats at the front of a crowd] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/
 files/7173620/download)\n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article or 
 chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gather in
 formation that will be useful to you in your class discussions\, your proj
 ects\, your final paper\, and especially your final exam.  Each homework 
 response should contain two paragraphs and at least three suggested discus
 sion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three p
 arts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the f
 inal\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise
  summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the
  summaries into one paragraph if that works. If it feels too confusing\, y
 ou can break them up into paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nP
 aragraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will help you on the final. Gathe
 r names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that will help you to construct your an
 swers for the final exam. Since the final is open note\, this section will
  help you to find what you need quickly if you organize it by question. So
  I would divide this portion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some da
 ys you won't have anything for most of the sections\, other days you'll ne
 ed to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions:
  \n-------------\n\nThree discussion questions. What do you think the cla
 ss should discuss about these readings and viewings? Some possible questio
 n types would be open-ended questions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil
 's advocate questions\, and more. You can see an example of this assignmen
 t in the Welcome module called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.inst
 ructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease
  Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses are due two hours before class o
 n Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you as much time as possible to proc
 rastinate\, and then it gives me time to read your questions and add them 
 to the discussion on some days.) Plan your time so that you can turn these
  in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the final exam as your guide: ga
 ther problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These readin
 g responses are your lifeline\, your place to gather knowledge and to writ
 e down great ideas and inspirational people.  This is a deceptively simpl
 e assignment\, and being too superficial and short in your reading journal
  will come back to haunt you later in the semester. You can use your notes
  on your quizzes and on the cumulative final. The notes are your future\, 
 so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This Assignment\n-------------------
 -------------\n\nThere are a lot of pieces to this group of readings and v
 iewings\, and unfortunately\, all of them have important pieces. I would w
 rite one sentence on everything except the film for the summaries.

 7 Thursday Reading Response: Rights & Representation\n--------------------
 -------------------------------------\n\n[about ten henna tattooed hands] 
 (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7173627/download)\n\nEver
 y time you see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a s
 ong\, or watch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful t
 o you in your class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and e
 specially your final exam.  Each homework response should contain two par
 agraphs and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three 
 Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses
 :\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions
 \n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or s
 ong(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph i
 f that works. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into parag
 raphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nTh
 ings that will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and id
 eas that will help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Since
  the final is open note\, this section will help you to find what you need
  quickly if you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion in
 to 5 parts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have anything for 
 most of the sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3
 \, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree disc
 ussion questions. What do you think the class should discuss about these r
 eadings and viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended que
 stions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and mor
 e. You can see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called 
 [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages
 /sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReading
  Responses are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This
  gives you as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives m
 e time to read your questions and add them to the discussion on some days.
 ) Plan your time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the qu
 estions on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, name
 s\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\,
  your place to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirat
 ional people.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too su
 perficial and short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you la
 ter in the semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cum
 ulative final. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructio
 ns for This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this assig
 nment\, you only have two things you're reading/watching\, and they overla
 p somewhat.

 -----\nWeek8 Tuesday Reading Response: Second Wave Feminism to the Present
 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n
 [demonstrators in washington dc] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/2295
 5/files/7173638/download)\n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article o
 r chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gather 
 information that will be useful to you in your class discussions\, your pr
 ojects\, your final paper\, and especially your final exam.  Each homewor
 k response should contain two paragraphs and at least three suggested disc
 ussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three
  parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the
  final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA conci
 se summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of t
 he summaries into one paragraph if that works. If it feels too confusing\,
  you can break them up into paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\
 nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will help you on the final. Gat
 her names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that will help you to construct your 
 answers for the final exam. Since the final is open note\, this section wi
 ll help you to find what you need quickly if you organize it by question. 
 So I would divide this portion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some 
 days you won't have anything for most of the sections\, other days you'll 
 need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Question
 s: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion questions. What do you think the c
 lass should discuss about these readings and viewings? Some possible quest
 ion types would be open-ended questions\, comparisons\, applications\, dev
 il's advocate questions\, and more. You can see an example of this assignm
 ent in the Welcome module called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.in
 structure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlea
 se Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses are due two hours before class
  on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you as much time as possible to pr
 ocrastinate\, and then it gives me time to read your questions and add the
 m to the discussion on some days.) Plan your time so that you can turn the
 se in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the final exam as your guide: 
 gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These read
 ing responses are your lifeline\, your place to gather knowledge and to wr
 ite down great ideas and inspirational people.  This is a deceptively sim
 ple assignment\, and being too superficial and short in your reading journ
 al will come back to haunt you later in the semester. You can use your not
 es on your quizzes and on the cumulative final. The notes are your future\
 , so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This Assignment\n-----------------
 ---------------\n\nFor this assignment\, you have several things of varyin
 g lengths. The film is the most important\, and the song is the least impo
 rtant. Try to explain in your response why each of these readings/viewings
  adds or complicates something important to the history of women's rights.

 nWeek8 Thursday Reading Response: Gender-based Violence Part I\n----------
 ----------------------------------------------------\n\n[young people at a
  party] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7173640/download)
 \n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, liste
 n to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gather information that will be 
 useful to you in your class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper
 \, and especially your final exam.  Each homework response should contain
  two paragraphs and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nTh
 e Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading r
 esponses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion q
 uestions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading
 (s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one par
 agraph if that works. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up in
 to paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n----------
 --\n\nThings that will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quote
 s and ideas that will help you to construct your answers for the final exa
 m. Since the final is open note\, this section will help you to find what 
 you need quickly if you organize it by question. So I would divide this po
 rtion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have anyth
 ing for most of the sections\, other days you'll need to put things down f
 or 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nTh
 ree discussion questions. What do you think the class should discuss about
  these readings and viewings? Some possible question types would be open-e
 nded questions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\,
  and more. You can see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module
  called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/229
 55/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\
 nReading Responses are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursday
 s. (This gives you as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it
  gives me time to read your questions and add them to the discussion on so
 me days.) Plan your time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUs
 e the questions on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamic
 s\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your li
 feline\, your place to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and 
 inspirational people.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and bein
 g too superficial and short in your reading journal will come back to haun
 t you later in the semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on
  the cumulative final. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nIn
 structions for This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor th
 is second assignment\, you have several short readings. To stay sane you w
 ill need to keep your summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just one se
 ntence for each reading that captures the point of it and differentiates i
 t from the others.

 3641/download)\n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article or chapter o
 r book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gather information
  that will be useful to you in your class discussions\, your projects\, yo
 ur final paper\, and especially your final exam.  Each homework response 
 should contain two paragraphs and at least three suggested discussion ques
 tions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three parts to t
 hese reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3
 . Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary 
 of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summarie
 s into one paragraph if that works. If it feels too confusing\, you can br
 eak them up into paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 
 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will help you on the final. Gather names\,
  terms\, quotes and ideas that will help you to construct your answers for
  the final exam. Since the final is open note\, this section will help you
  to find what you need quickly if you organize it by question. So I would 
 divide this portion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some days you wo
 n't have anything for most of the sections\, other days you'll need to put
  things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-----
 --------\n\nThree discussion questions. What do you think the class should
  discuss about these readings and viewings? Some possible question types w
 ould be open-ended questions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil's advoca
 te questions\, and more. You can see an example of this assignment in the 
 Welcome module called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.c
 om/courses/22955/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n-
 -----------\n\nReading Responses are due two hours before class on Tuesday
 s and Thursdays. (This gives you as much time as possible to procrastinate
 \, and then it gives me time to read your questions and add them to the di
 scussion on some days.) Plan your time so that you can turn these in by 2:
 00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the final exam as your guide: gather prob
 lems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These reading respons
 es are your lifeline\, your place to gather knowledge and to write down gr
 eat ideas and inspirational people.  This is a deceptively simple assignm
 ent\, and being too superficial and short in your reading journal will com
 e back to haunt you later in the semester. You can use your notes on your 
 quizzes and on the cumulative final. The notes are your future\, so use th
 em well.\n\nInstructions for This Assignment\n----------------------------
 ----\n\nFor this second assignment\, you have several short readings. To s
 tay sane you will need to keep your summaries for part 1 short. Try to wri
 te just one sentence for each reading that captures the point of it and di
 fferentiates it from the others.

 les:\n--------------\n\nGood Example:\n-------------\n\nThis is a topic th
 at is right-sized for a 6-8 page paper:\n\nMy final paper is going to exam
 ine how androcentrism makes it easier for tall women\, especially those th
 at present more masculine in behavior and dress\, to get ahead in the work
 place above short women. I will address how this is harmful to all women\,
  even those who benefit from this corporate system.\n\nWeak Example:\n----
 ---------\n\nThis is a topic that is too broad for a 6-8 page paper: \n\n
 My topic is the issue of social justice issues being run by people in plac
 es of privilege. \n\nFor Your Convenience:  Grading Rubric/Paper Outline

DESCRIPTION:---------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------\nWeek10 Tuesday Reading Response: Maternal Morbidity &
  Mortality\, At Home & Abroad\n-------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------\n\n[mother and baby touching noses
 ] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7173668/download)\n\nEv
 ery time you see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a
  song\, or watch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful
  to you in your class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and
  especially your final exam.  Each homework response should contain two p
 aragraphs and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Thre
 e Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading respons
 es:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questio
 ns\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or
  song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph
  if that works. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into par
 agraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\n
 Things that will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and 
 ideas that will help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Sin
 ce the final is open note\, this section will help you to find what you ne
 ed quickly if you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion 
 into 5 parts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have anything fo
 r most of the sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\,
  3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree di
 scussion questions. What do you think the class should discuss about these
  readings and viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended q
 uestions\, comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and m
 ore. You can see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module calle
 d [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pag
 es/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReadi
 ng Responses are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (Th
 is gives you as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives
  me time to read your questions and add them to the discussion on some day
 s.) Plan your time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the 
 questions on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, na
 mes\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline
 \, your place to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspir
 ational people.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too 
 superficial and short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you 
 later in the semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the c
 umulative final. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstruct
 ions for This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this sec
 ond assignment\, you have several short readings. To stay sane you will ne
 ed to keep your summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just one sentence
  for each reading that captures the point of it and differentiates it from
  the others.

 n the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas
 \, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your pla
 ce to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirational peo
 ple.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too superficial
  and short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you later in th
 e semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cumulative f
 inal. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructions for Th
 is Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this second assignm
 ent\, you have several short readings. To stay sane you will need to keep 
 your summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just one sentence for each r
 eading that captures the point of it and differentiates it from the others

 Instructions:\n---------------------\n\nAfter doing some initial research 
 on the "problem facing women today" that you have chosen\, write out the t
 hree or four possible solutions you'll be considering in your paper. Write
  these out in a phrase or a sentence for each. This assignment is more abo

 man-lying-on-a-sofa-with-a-notebook-on-her-face-8547448/)\n\nWrite a 6-8 p
 age paper on the following topic: Choose one problem facing women today. 
  Past papers have included the gender wage gap\, obstetric fistulas\, dayc
 are\, women in STEM education or STEM fields\, FGM\, the glass ceiling\, d
 omestic abuse\, and many other topics. Present your problem clearly and sh
 ow how it holds women (and society) back from reaching their full potentia
 l. Explore 3-4 different solutions to this problem\, and choose which solu
 tion has the most potential to make a real difference in women’s lives. 
 Make a persuasive argument for your chosen solution\, with support (such a
 s data\, studies\, testimonials\, theory\, etc.) to substantiate your clai
 m.  (The 6-8 pages should be typewritten\, double-spaced\, using Arial\, 
 Times New Roman\, or another standard font\, have 1" margins\, and you sho
 uld use the MLA\, Chicago\, or the style manual typically used in your fie
 ld.)\n\nBelow are the grading criteria which will be used\, and a fairly s
 pecific outline:\n\nPaper Outline\n-------------\n\n1. First sentence\, In
 tro to problem\n-----------------------------------\n\n* --Intro to the pr
 oblem: Enough to understand the problem\, the dynamics involved\, and the
  basic situation.\n\n* --Not too much intro to problem: 2-3 sentences tops
 .\n\n* --Not too much digression at this point – lead quickly to thesis.
 \n\n \n\n2. Problem/question\n-------------------\n\n* --Is your problem 
 or question easy to identify?\n\n* -- is there a minimum of digression at 
 this point? Do you lead quickly to your thesis?\n\n \n\n3. Thesis/ Map\n-
 -------------\n\n* -- Easy to identify      \n\n* --Short and uncomp
 licated\n\n* --List main points: What are 2-3 solutions to your problem?
   Which is the best one?\n\n* --Something like\, “In this paper\, I wil
 l argue that…” (this is a general statement\, let the map outline your
  method)\n\n* -- Content – does the thesis make a convincing and compell
 ing/relevant/interesting argument?\n\n \n\n4. Possible Solutions to Probl
 ems:\n----------------------------------\n\n* Identify 3-4 possible soluti
 ons\, then explain each one\, and explain why people argue for it. \n\n 
 \n\n5. Best Solution:\n-----------------\n\n* Why? How can you back up you
 r claim with specific evidence?\n\n \n\n6. Paragraphs: Topic Sentences (S
 pend most time here and on #7 and #10)\n----------------------------------
 -------------------------------------\n\n* --Topic sentence: does every si
 ngle paragraph have one?\n\n* --Does your topic sentence make a claim that
  you will substantiate in the body of your paragraph?\n\n* --Do you use yo
 ur own voice exclusively? (no quotes in topic sentences)\n\n \n\n7. Parag
 raphs: Data\, Quotes\, Paraphrases: (Spend most time here and on #6 and # 
 10)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------\n\n* --Do you introduce every single quote or point of data
 ? (What should the reader notice about the upcoming quote?   Who said it?
   In what context?) \n\n* --Do you include a detailed analysis after eac
 h quote? (Interpret and expound upon quote – do not summarize)\n\n* In y
 our analysis\, do you address why/how the quote supports your topic senten
 ce\, your thesis and your argument? \n\n \n\n8. Conclusion:\n-----------
 ---\n\n* What does this mean for the treatment of the problem?  What stil
 l needs to be done? \n\n \n\n9. Citations/ Works Cited/ Footnotes:\n----
 ---------------------------------\n\n* Do you have an appropriate number o
 f citations (roughly as many citations as pages in the paper\, at least 6\
 , but not more than 12)\n\n* Citations are in a consistent format (MLA\, A
 PA\, Chicago\, etc.)\n\n \n\n10. Overall Success of Paper: (Spend most ti
 me here and on #6 and # 7)\n----------------------------------------------
 ------------------------\n\n* Do you have a logical order to your argument
 ?\n\n* Is your argument convincing\, and does the paper flow well (transit
 ions)?\n\n* How is your spelling/grammar/word choice/ register (formal or

DESCRIPTION:--------------------------------------------------------\nWeek1
 1 Tuesday Reading Response: Sex\, Power\, & Intimacy\n--------------------
 ------------------------------------\n\n[couple sitting on a rock] (https:
 //byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/files/7173681/download)\n\nEvery time 
 you see a film\, read an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, o
 r watch a video\, you will gather information that will be useful to you i
 n your class discussions\, your projects\, your final paper\, and especial
 ly your final exam.  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs
  and at least three suggested discussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n
 ---------------\n\nThere are three parts to these reading responses:\n\n1.
  Summaries\n\n2. Resources for the final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nPar
 agraph 1:\n------------\n\nA concise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) 
 or video(s) assigned. Put all of the summaries into one paragraph if that 
 works. If it feels too confusing\, you can break them up into paragraphs a
 nd use a "summaries" heading. \n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings th
 at will help you on the final. Gather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas tha
 t will help you to construct your answers for the final exam. Since the fi
 nal is open note\, this section will help you to find what you need quickl
 y if you organize it by question. So I would divide this portion into 5 pa
 rts\, one for each question. Some days you won't have anything for most of
  the sections\, other days you'll need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4
  of the questions. \n\n3 Questions: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion 
 questions. What do you think the class should discuss about these readings
  and viewings? Some possible question types would be open-ended questions\
 , comparisons\, applications\, devil's advocate questions\, and more. You 
 can see an example of this assignment in the Welcome module called [Sample
  Reading Response] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample
 -reading-journal-entry). \n\nPlease Note:\n------------\n\nReading Respon
 ses are due two hours before class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives 
 you as much time as possible to procrastinate\, and then it gives me time 
 to read your questions and add them to the discussion on some days.) Plan 
 your time so that you can turn these in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions
  on the final exam as your guide: gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ide
 as\, solutions\, etc.  These reading responses are your lifeline\, your p
 lace to gather knowledge and to write down great ideas and inspirational p
 eople.  This is a deceptively simple assignment\, and being too superfici
 al and short in your reading journal will come back to haunt you later in 
 the semester. You can use your notes on your quizzes and on the cumulative
  final. The notes are your future\, so use them well.\n\nInstructions for 
 This Assignment\n--------------------------------\n\nFor this second assig
 nment\, you have several short readings. To stay sane you will need to kee
 p your summaries for part 1 short. Try to write just one sentence for each
  reading that captures the point of it and differentiates it from the othe
 rs.

 cing women today.  Past papers have included the gender wage gap\, obstet
 ric fistulas\, daycare\, women in STEM education or STEM fields\, FGM\, th
 e glass ceiling\, domestic abuse\, and many other topics. Present your pro
 blem clearly and show how it holds women (and society) back from reaching

 3. Thesis/ Map\n--------------\n\n* -- Easy to identify      \n\n* -

DESCRIPTION:------------------------------------------------\nWeek13 Tuesda
 y Reading Response: Law & Politics\n--------------------------------------
 ----------\n\n[part of a building] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/22
 955/files/7173700/download)\n\nEvery time you see a film\, read an article
  or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video\, you will gathe
 r information that will be useful to you in your class discussions\, your 
 projects\, your final paper\, and especially your final exam.  Each homew
 ork response should contain two paragraphs and at least three suggested di
 scussion questions. \n\nThe Three Parts\n---------------\n\nThere are thr
 ee parts to these reading responses:\n\n1. Summaries\n\n2. Resources for t
 he final\n\n3. Discussion questions\n\nParagraph 1:\n------------\n\nA con
 cise summary of the reading(s) or song(s) or video(s) assigned. Put all of
  the summaries into one paragraph if that works. If it feels too confusing
 \, you can break them up into paragraphs and use a "summaries" heading. \
 n\nParagraph 2:\n------------\n\nThings that will help you on the final. G
 ather names\, terms\, quotes and ideas that will help you to construct you
 r answers for the final exam. Since the final is open note\, this section 
 will help you to find what you need quickly if you organize it by question
 . So I would divide this portion into 5 parts\, one for each question. Som
 e days you won't have anything for most of the sections\, other days you'l
 l need to put things down for 2\, 3\, or 4 of the questions. \n\n3 Questi
 ons: \n-------------\n\nThree discussion questions. What do you think the
  class should discuss about these readings and viewings? Some possible que
 stion types would be open-ended questions\, comparisons\, applications\, d
 evil's advocate questions\, and more. You can see an example of this assig
 nment in the Welcome module called [Sample Reading Response] (https://byu.
 instructure.com/courses/22955/pages/sample-reading-journal-entry). \n\nPl
 ease Note:\n------------\n\nReading Responses are due two hours before cla
 ss on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (This gives you as much time as possible to 
 procrastinate\, and then it gives me time to read your questions and add t
 hem to the discussion on some days.) Plan your time so that you can turn t
 hese in by 2:00 pm. \n\nUse the questions on the final exam as your guide
 : gather problems\, dynamics\, names\, ideas\, solutions\, etc.  These re
 ading responses are your lifeline\, your place to gather knowledge and to 
 write down great ideas and inspirational people.  This is a deceptively s
 imple assignment\, and being too superficial and short in your reading jou
 rnal will come back to haunt you later in the semester. You can use your n
 otes on your quizzes and on the cumulative final. The notes are your futur
 e\, so use them well.\n\nInstructions for This Assignment\n---------------
 -----------------\n\nFor this assignment\, you have a film and 3 short rea
 dings. To stay sane you will need to keep your summaries for part 1 short.
  Try to write a short paragraph on RBG and one sentence for the 3 readings
  that captures the point of it and differentiates it from the others.

  an article or chapter or book\, listen to a song\, or watch a video\, you
  will gather information that will be useful to you in your class discussi

  Each homework response should contain two paragraphs and at least three s

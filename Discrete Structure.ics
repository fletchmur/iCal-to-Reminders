 [\neg A(x)\vee C(x)] \\ 3. \forall x\,w \ [\neg C(x) \vee F(w)] \)\nProble
 m 2.\nLet the domain of the variables x\, y\, and w be the set {a\,b\,c}. 
 Given the following premises\, use resolution\, universal generalization (
 Table 2 in seciton 1.6.7)\, and universal instantiation to prove ∀x B(x). 
 \n\(1.\ \neg A(x) \vee B(y) \\ 2.\ \neg C(x) \vee G(w) \\ 3.\ \neg G(x) \\
  4.\ A(x)\)\nProblem 3.\nRepeat problem 2\, but prove ∀w ¬C(w)\nNote that 
 'Universal Generalization' use used when you need to turn an arbitrary w i
 nto an arbitrary x (when neither variable is specified\, it is arbitrary a
 nd must hold for all values it can take on).\nProblem 4.\nDo problem 6 fro
 m this link.\n \nWhen problem six uses the word 'Algebraically\,' just use
  rules of inference in each step of your transformation.\nNote: (This is n
 ot a HW question)\nWhy can I go from \n∀ x P(x) ∧ ∃ z R(z)\nto\n∀ ∃ z x P(
 x) ∧ R(z) ?\nBecause the scope of the ∃ z is the same for both statements.
  This process is called the null quantification rule and it's defined in p
 roblems 48-51 in the homework at the end of section 1.4.\n \n

 g a single time of day. Your FSA should accept times such as: \n12:36 pm 1
 :59 am 4:00 pm 2:45 am\nNote that there are no leading zeros. Also\, am an
 d pm are lowercase and have no periods. A terminal error state is not nece
 ssary. To make the task easier\, you can make up any grouping you want. Fo
 r example\, you may wish to let represent any digit\, let represent the di
 git 1\, let represent any digit 0 through 2\, and let represent a space. T
 ime statements are formatted in many ways\, but we want your FSA to only a
 ccept the above time format − not military time or any other time format.
 \n2. Give a regular expression for the FSA described in the previous quest
 ion.\n \n3. Draw the following Finite State Automata (FSAs) needed for pro
 ject 1.\na. An FSA that recognizes the language consisting of 'strings' in
  Project 1 (see Definition 4 from section 13.3.4 and the description of Pr
 oject 1 under Course Content). A string is a sequence of characters enclos
 ed in single quotes. White space (space\, tab) is not skipped when inside 
 a string. Two adjacent single quotes within a string denote an apostrophe.
  The line number for a string token is the line where the string begins. I
 f a string is not terminated (end of file is encountered before the end of
  the string)\, the token becomes an undefined token.\nb. An FSA that recog
 nizes the language consisting of 'line comments' in Project 1.  A line com
 ment starts with a hash character (#) and ends at the end of the line or e
 nd of the file.\nc. An FSA that recognizes the language consisting of 'blo
 ck comments' in Project 1. A block comment starts with #| and ends with |#
 . Block comments may cover multiple lines. Block comments can be empty and
  multiple comments can appear on the same line. The line number for a comm
 ent token is the line where the comment begins. If a block comment is not 
 terminated (end of file is encountered before the end of the comment)\, th
 e token becomes an undefined token.\nSubmit a picture of your work to this
